      This sample project is a demonstration of a React-based application            hosting a DocumentViewer component. The DocumentViewer component is            designed to process Docutils XML into a React component tree for            rendering. Itï¿½s especially designed for Sphinx XML output but should            also work with vanilla Docutils output (such as from 
      <code
        className="doc-literal"
      >
        rst2xml
      </code>
      ).
    </p>
  </section>
</div>
